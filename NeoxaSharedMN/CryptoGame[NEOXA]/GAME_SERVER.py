Level 4 (Root):
Merkle Root Hash: fdaabbccddeeffff

Each hash in a Merkle Tree can contain 83 bytes of data, 
this allows for the use of a large variety of applications
on the chain such as game or dapps. 30 hashes as shown above
from Root hash reconstruction can host up to 28/29/30 x 83 bytes
of data, we can use CBOR/Hex on SVG images to inscribe them to a
Merkle Tree that can be loaded by a front end loaded by calling
the Merkle Tree, any change in any Hash when reforming the data
will result in a different Root hash. Essentially making the only
way to get X from Y is by following the Merkle Root Hash tree. 

There is no limit of leaf levels and nodes. The only limit is BLOCK SIZE.

100ln x 83b = 8.3 KB ## May be off by 2ln
200ln x 83b = 16.6 KB ## " <> "

Creating a "Guess the Number" game inside a Merkle tree 
involves structuring the game's data in a way that allows participants to guess
numbers and verify results through the Merkle tree. 
Here's an example of how you can structure the Merkle tree for this game:

Assuming you want to create a game with 8 rounds (8 leaf nodes) where each round
involves guessing a number, let's structure the tree:

Level 0 (Root):
Merkle Root Hash (Initial Hash): [Initial Hash Value]

Level 1:
Round 1 Hash: [Hash of Guess1]
Round 2 Hash: [Hash of Guess2]
Round 3 Hash: [Hash of Guess3]
Round 4 Hash: [Hash of Guess4]
Round 5 Hash: [Hash of Guess5]
Round 6 Hash: [Hash of Guess6]
Round 7 Hash: [Hash of Guess7]
Round 8 Hash: [Hash of Guess8]

Level 2:
Round 1-2 Hash: [Hash of Round 1 Hash + Round 2 Hash]
Round 3-4 Hash: [Hash of Round 3 Hash + Round 4 Hash]
Round 5-6 Hash: [Hash of Round 5 Hash + Round 6 Hash]
Round 7-8 Hash: [Hash of Round 7 Hash + Round 8 Hash]

Level 3:
Round 1-4 Hash: [Hash of Round 1-2 Hash + Round 3-4 Hash]
Round 5-8 Hash: [Hash of Round 5-6 Hash + Round 7-8 Hash]

Level 4 (Root):
Merkle Root Hash (Final Hash): [Hash of Round 1-4 Hash + Round 5-8 Hash]

In this structure, each "Guess" is stored in leaf nodes.
Participants can submit their guesses for each round.
The hashes of these guesses are combined in pairs,
and the resulting hashes are further combined until you reach the root.
The final root hash represents the collective result of all the rounds.

To play the game, participants would submit their guesses and their corresponding
round numbers. The Merkle tree's structure allows anyone to verify the results by
comparing the final root hash with the expected value. If the guess is correct for
each round, the root hash remains the same. If there's any tampering, the root hash will change.


This Merkle tree structure provides an immutable and tamper-evident record of the game's results.
